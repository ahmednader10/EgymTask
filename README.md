A Simple java application that parses an xml file (map.xml) which describes a game map.
The map has rooms and each room might have some objects to collect. Rooms can 
lead to each other through the 4 main cardinal directions. The aim is to collect
some objects from the available rooms. The required objects to collect and the 
starting point are parsed as input from an input text files (config1.txt and
config2.txt).
The output of the application is a valid route that the player can take to collect
all the desired objects from the rooms.

To run the application you have to clone the repository and just run the main method 
in InputOutput.java class.
